Open source Matter over Thread firmware for the Shelly 1 Gen4. Works natively with Apple Home, Google Home, Alexa, and Home Assistant — no WiFi, no cloud, no Shelly app, no subscription. **The Gen4's ESP32-C6 has an 802.15.4 radio used for Zigbee on stock firmware — this firmware reconfigures it to run Thread instead, unlocking Matter over Thread.**

*Shelly 1 Gen4 running v1.0.0 of this firmware, commissioned to Apple Home. Manufacturer: AUTOMATOUS.IO, Model: Shelly 1 Gen4 MoT Light.*

> This release is the **Light variant** — Matter `On/Off Light` device type with **latching relay behavior**. The relay holds whatever state you set (on or off) until you change it again. The Shelly appears as a light bulb icon in your smart home app, and the relay can switch any "set and hold" load.
>
> **Power-on behavior:** Defaults to **off** at power-up. Configurable via the Matter StartUpOnOff attribute (off, on, toggle, restore last state) — Home Assistant users can write this attribute directly via Matter cluster editing. Apple Home and Google Home have limited Matter attribute UIs currently, so the firmware default applies in those ecosystems until their Matter attribute UIs improve.
>
> A future **Switch variant** will add **momentary relay pulse** behavior for applications that expect a brief contact closure — garage door openers, doorbells, gates, and similar pulse-activated devices. Variants are separate firmware builds because Matter device types are declared at compile time and cannot be changed in the smart home app after commissioning.

> ⚠️ Uses ESP-Matter SDK test credentials (not VID/PID-certified). Functional for personal use; not suitable for resale as a certified Matter product.

## Flashing

**Have a [Thread Border Router](#compatible-hubs), USB-UART adapter, and 1.27mm to 2.54mm adapter? You're ready.**

The flashing process takes about 15 minutes total: 5 minutes to wire up, 5–10 minutes for the original firmware backup, and 1–2 minutes to flash the new firmware.

> ⚠️ **Before you start:** Never connect the Shelly to AC mains while flashing. The programming header is not galvanically isolated from mains circuitry. See [the full safety warning](docs/FLASHING.md#safety-warning) for details.

**[→ Full Flashing Guide](docs/FLASHING.md)** — step-by-step instructions with safety warnings, wiring diagrams, photos, and command-line alternatives.

## Commissioning

### Status LED Reference

Follows Shelly's standard convention — solid LED means connected and working.

| LED Pattern | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Off | Device starting up |
| Rapid blink | BLE advertising — ready for commissioning |
| Slow blink | Joining Thread network |
| Solid on | Connected and operational |

### Before Commissioning

- Commission devices ONE AT A TIME.
- Power off or move away other un-commissioned devices while setting up each one.
- All devices share the same pairing code, so the controller may get confused if multiple are advertising simultaneously.
- Once commissioned, each device gets a unique identity on your network.
- Disconnect UART from the Shelly and install wherever you need to.

### Apple Home

Scan this QR code with the Home app, or enter the setup code manually:

![Matter Setup QR Code](docs/images/matter_qrcode_20202021_3840.png)

1. Open the **Home** app.
2. Tap **+** → **Add Accessory**.
3. Scan the QR code above, or tap **More Options** to enter the setup code manually.
4. Press **Add Anyway** when prompted (this is expected — see [Matter and Thread Certification](#matter-and-thread-certification)).
5. Name the device and place it in a room.

```
Setup code: 3497-011-2332
```

 >**Note for users coming from HomeKit Bridge / Home Assistant setups:** HomeKit's "reclassify as Fan / Light / Switch" option (available when bridging a stock Shelly through Home Assistant) is not available with native Matter devices. The Matter device type is declared by the firmware at flash time and cannot be changed in the Apple Home app. If you need a different device type, flash the corresponding [variant](#shelly-1-gen4--matter-over-thread) when one is available.


> ⚠️ This is the ESP-Matter SDK test setup code, used by all devices running this firmware. Once a device is commissioned to your Matter fabric, the setup code is no longer used for authentication — your Matter ecosystem manages credentials going forward. Multiple uncommissioned devices broadcasting the same setup code is why the commissioning instructions specify one device at a time.
 
<details>
<summary>Google Home / Alexa / Home Assistant commissioning</summary>
Google Home and Alexa support Matter commissioning via their respective apps. Use setup code `3497-011-2332` or the QR Code above when prompted. Google and Alexa hubs have not been directly tested but the firmware should work with any Matter-compliant hub. Let me know and we'll update compatible hubs section!
 
</details>

---

## Factory Reset
 
Hold the onboard relay button for **several seconds**. The device will reset and re-enter BLE commissioning mode. The LED will return to the **rapid blink** pattern from the [Status LED Reference](#status-led-reference), confirming the reset worked. Make sure to remove the device from whatever ecosystems you've added it to before re-commissioning.

## Known Issues / Roadmap

- [ ] OTA updates (exploratory) - Currently users must reflash via USB-UART for updates.
- [ ] Switch variant — momentary relay pulse (~500ms) for garage door openers, doorbells, gates, and similar pulse-activated devices. Separate firmware build since Matter device types are declared at compile time.
- [ ] Thermal protection validation — the firmware reads ESP32-C6 die temperature and includes logic to cut off the relay above 75°C, but this has not been validated under controlled thermal conditions. Feature is implemented but not confirmed working as documented.

## Matter and Thread Certification

This firmware is **not** Matter Certified or Thread Certified. It uses Espressif's ESP-Matter SDK and OpenThread but has not been submitted to the CSA or Thread Group for certification. During commissioning, expect a one-time "Add Anyway" or similar uncertified device warning — this is normal and expected.

See [docs/CERTIFICATION.md](docs/CERTIFICATION.md) for full details on what uncertified status means, test credentials, and trademark notices.

## Why?

The Shelly 1 Gen4 ships with an ESP32-C6 that includes an 802.15.4 radio capable of running both Thread and Zigbee. Shelly's stock firmware uses this radio for Zigbee and runs Matter over WiFi — Thread is not used. Shelly has stated they have no plans to add Thread support. This firmware reconfigures the radio to run Thread (OpenThread), unlocking Matter over Thread.

### Why Matter over Thread, and not ESPHome or Tasmota?

ESPHome and Tasmota are excellent firmware projects, but both effectively assume you have a central controller — Home Assistant for ESPHome, an MQTT broker plus a controller for Tasmota. They're great if that's your setup. They're a problem if it isn't.

This firmware speaks Matter directly. There's no middleware required, no HA instance, no MQTT broker, no ESPHome dashboard, no YAML configs, no bridge:

- **Apple Home user without Home Assistant?** It just works. Commission directly from the Home app.
- **Google Home or Alexa user?** Same — direct Matter commissioning, no third-party hub.
- **Home Assistant user?** Also works — commission via HA's Matter integration.
- **Multi-ecosystem household?** Multi-fabric commissioning lets the same device live in Apple Home, HA, and Google Home simultaneously.

Matter is an industry-standard protocol — your devices work with the ecosystems you have today, and remain compatible with new Matter ecosystems as they appear.

### Why Thread instead of WiFi?

Matter over Thread offers lower power consumption, lower latency, and mesh networking that doesn't depend on your WiFi. Devices on a Thread network can use any compatible Thread Border Router (iPhone 15 Pro+, HomePod mini, Apple TV 4K, Nest Hub 2nd gen, HA SkyConnect/Yellow) and continue to function even if your WiFi is down or congested.

I built this because I needed lower-power smart home devices in my Sprinter van where battery and solar capacity are limited and WiFi isn't always reliable. If you're an off-grid, low-power, or simply Thread-curious user, you might find this useful too.

## About

This firmware was created from inside an old Mercedes Sprinter T1N named Mabel, parked somewhere in the USA.

I put many sleepless nights obsessing about Thread support that kickstarted me into writing custom firmware and testing using ESP-IDF, ESP-Matter, and ESPHome examples — figuring out Shelly's custom partition offsets, GPIO quirks specific to this device, and getting Matter over Thread commissioning working on non-devkit hardware.

If it saved you the same headache, consider leaving a ⭐ on the repo — it helps the project show up in GitHub search and signals to other Shelly 1 Gen4 owners that this firmware exists and works.
